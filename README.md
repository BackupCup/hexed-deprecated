## Tired of the same old enchantments and curses in Minecraft? Prepare to delve into the realm of **Hexes** with this mod! 

For ages, Minecraft players have been limited to two options: **enchantments** for buffs and **curses** for penalties. But now, the game is about to change. Inspired by the daring mechanics of Terraria's Calamity Mod, **Hexes** introduce a tantalizing middle ground. 

These powerful enchantments offer unique mechanics that can turn the tide of any battle. But beware, for every boon comes a burden. Each Hex carries its own downside, forcing you to weigh the risks and rewards of each choice.

**Hexed** is all about variety. With at least four unique Hexes available for each piece of equipment, you'll never run out of ways to customize your gameplay. **Some Hexes may even synergize with each other, offering even greater power at a cost.**

## Hexed adds a new interactable block:
  - Accursed Altar - A new variation of the Enchanting Table, in which you're able to choose what Hex do you want to put on the item, each Hex has a detailed description that is visible when hovering over it's Alchemical Symbol. Consumes a Brimstone Crystal on use and extinguishes all 6 Brimstone Candles in the marked places.

## **Hexed** also adds new building blocks, flora and most importantly - ***Plushies***

## All recipes show up in EMI, REI, JEI and the Vanilla Recipe Book.

For the most part, Hexed is compatible with all the mods, there is an exception however:
 - Because in the code, Hexes count as curses, **Enchancement** will override hexes if you don't have a Curse Patch for it.

- Q: Does Hexed add any new mobs?
  - A: Technically yes. There is a hex for a Trident that will spawn exploding enemies on hit.
- Q: How many enchantments does this mod add?
  - A: Currently, more than 25. With new updates as I get new ideas, I'm gonna add more
- Q: Who is the plushie in the maid outfit?
  - A: Supreme Witch, Calamitas in a maid outfit. Bit of an inside joke of the Terraria's Calamity Mod community.
- Q: Are you gonna backport?
  - A: There is just too much stuff in the mod already to backport. Mojang also keeps making new updates each month, so my attention is focused on updating to those new versions primarily.
- Q: Are you gonna add a Forge/Neoforged version?
  - A: Again, there is just too much stuff to move from one Modloader to another. Forge is completely different from Fabric, so that would mean relearning everything. I do not have the time for that.
